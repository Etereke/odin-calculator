# odin-calculator

This is an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). The theme of the exercise was creating a small project using the knowledge acquired during the Foundations course of The Odin Project.

The task was to create a calculator with basic functionality. It can add, subtract, multiply and divide. Press the digit buttons for entering the left-hand value, then press an operator, enter the right-hand value. After that, either pressing '=' or another operator evaluates the operation.

Pressing the 'C' button will clear the display and erase previously entered values from memory. The '<-' button erases one character. The '.' button adds a decimal point to the left- or right-hand value (if it doesn't contain one).

The page works with keyboard inputs too. Enter 0-9 for digits, + - * / for operations, . for decimal point, 'c' for clear, backspace for deleting a character, and either = or enter to evaluate.
